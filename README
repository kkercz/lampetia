This is supposed to eventually become a ray tracing renderer.
Based on the book "The Ray Tracer Challenge: A Test-Driven Guide to Your First 3D Renderer" by Jamis Buck.

The project is named Lampetia after a Greek mythology character
who was apparently a "personification of light" (source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lampetia).
